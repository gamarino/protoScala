### Added

- **Lexer** for Scala 3 lexical syntax: alphanumeric, operator, mixed and
  backquoted identifiers; hard and soft keywords; decimal, hex and binary
  integers with `_` and `L`; floating-point literals; characters and strings
  with escapes; triple-quoted strings; interpolated strings as structured
  tokens; nested comments.
- **Significant indentation** (Scala 3 offside rule) and braces, mixable;
  `end` markers.
- **Parser and compiler** for `val`, `var`, `lazy val`, `def` (multiple
  parameter lists, varargs, `@main`), `if`/`then`/`else`, `while`/`do`,
  blocks, lambdas, closures with per-activation captures, `return` in
  methods, imports (parsed).
- **Bytecode VM** on protoCore with SmallInteger fast paths and
  arbitrary-precision promotion (D1), Java-style double printing,
  `StackOverflowError` instead of crashes.
- **Standard surface:** `println`, `print`, methods of Int, Double, Boolean,
  Char, String, List (varargs) and functions.
- **REPL** with readline history, multi-line continuation, `:help`, `:quit`,
  `:load`.
- **Tooling:** `--disassemble`; conformance, unit and CLI test suites;
  tutorial chapters 1–5 and 14.
- Design specification (`docs/DESIGN.md`), language reference
  (`docs/LANGUAGE.md`), roadmap, status tracker and interop design.
- Platform specifications for protoCore: `ProtoMap`
  (`docs/platform/PROTOMAP-SPEC.md`) and `ProtoMPSCQueue`
  (`docs/platform/PMQ-SPEC.md`).
- Actor model on protoClojure's design with the `actor-bench.sh` suite
  (DESIGN §8).
- Implementation plans for Phase P1 and Phase 1 (`docs/plans/`).
- Phase 0 skeleton: CMake build against protoCore, `protoscala --version` /
  `--help`, GoogleTest unit harness, conformance runner with `// EXPECT:`
  directives, CLI tests.
