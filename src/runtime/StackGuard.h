/*
 * StackGuard — native stack checks and the stack size of runtime threads.
 *
 * The bytecode VM runs every non-tail call as a nested
 * ExecutionEngine::execute on the native stack, and the printer, value
 * equality and value hashing recurse natively over nested collections. A
 * recursion deeper than the thread's stack would crash the process with
 * SIGSEGV; checkNativeStack turns it into a StackOverflowError, the analogue
 * of the JVM's java.lang.StackOverflowError, which the script driver and the
 * REPL handle like any other Scala runtime error. The parser and the
 * compiler recurse once per level of nested source constructs and check with
 * StackUse::Source; their callers report the error as a compile error.
 *
 * The check compares the address of a local variable with a per-thread
 * limit: the lowest address of the thread's stack, as the thread library
 * reports it (pthread_getattr_np), plus kStackReserveBytes. The limit is
 * computed on the first check a thread makes, so the check needs no
 * per-thread set-up and adapts to any stack size: the evaluator thread,
 * threads created by protoCore, the main thread under any `ulimit -s`. No
 * guard page and no signal handler are involved.
 *
 * Depth. The script runner and the REPL run on the evaluator thread, whose
 * stack holds kThreadStackBytes; later phases' worker threads get the same
 * stack size through configureThreadStacks, so a recursion reaches the same
 * depth on every kind of thread. Stack pages are committed only when a
 * recursion touches them.
