// It replaces std::counting_semaphore, whose libstdc++ 13 implementation can
// lose a wakeup (protoST S19): _M_release notifies only when the count was 0, and a
// waiter that read a non-zero count, lost the compare-and-swap for that permit
// and then went to sleep on the stale non-zero value misses every later
// release that finds the count above 0. Observed as a worker parked for ever
// in acquire() with a permit available, so the runtime waited on its join.
//
// Here a waiter sleeps only on the value 0 — the kernel refuses the sleep if
// the count has changed — and every release notifies. The count is an int so
// that std::atomic::wait maps onto the platform wait (a futex on Linux).
